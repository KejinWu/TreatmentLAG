# TreatmentLAG
Combined with DTVEM package, people can use this function to check the existence of optimal lags of exogenous variables within intensive longitudinal data. 
A VARX model will be fitted to present the lag structre of data.
# Getting started
First step of applying this function is installing the DTVEM package which can be acquired from http://www.nicholasjacobson.com/project/dtvem/.

And the Example R file illustrates how to perform TreatmentLAG on simulated data.
